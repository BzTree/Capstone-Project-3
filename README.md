# Capstone-Project-3

This repository is built for the purpose of containing the files needed for Capstone Project 3 of JCDSOL15.
The following files are available in this repository:

- .ipynb notebook containing the whole process of processing the data and training the model to predict churn, from analyzing effect of different data cleaning mechanisms to comparing different hyperparameters on the best models and rebalancers as determined through experiment.
- The presentation to better visually assess the effectiveness of the Machine Learning (ML) model vs the rule-based model.
- The 'pickle' file containing the final model as determined in both the presentation and the notebook.
- This README, containing the summary of this repository.

In building the ML model, the processing of the dataset can be summarized as follows:

- The dataset has info on the churn of customers as well as various data that can be used to predict future churn.
- 

This project also has a video presentation found in the link below.

The file (in Google Colab) and presentation (both the file and video presentation) is also available in this Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WWJopsnzgc1w2hw821fv60TyqFBB6ViD?usp=sharing
